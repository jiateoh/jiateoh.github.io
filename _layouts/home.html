<p>
	I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Databricks! I have previously worked at Acryl Data, Twitter/X, and LinkedIn. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science (<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xp367hd">link to thesis</a>) in 2022 at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/">Professor Miryung Kim</a> in the Software Evolution and Analysis Laboratory. I also worked closely with <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/">Professor Harry Xu</a> and <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~gulzar/">Professor Muhammad Ali Gulzar</a>. More information about my professional experience can be found on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiateoh/">LinkedIn page</a> and resume/CV.

	My research focused on improving developer experiences with Big Data systems, with an emphasis on performance and correctness debugging. My prior works investigate how to enhance performance debugging for computation skew in Apache Spark and improve data provenance precision in dataflow applications through a combination of taint analysis and influence-based aggregation functions. Towards the end of my Ph.D., I explored techniques which leverage targeted fuzz testing of individual user-defined functions in tandem with skew-inspired mutation operators to generate workloads which reproduce specified performance symptoms, particularly in scenarios where no suitable datasets are available.
