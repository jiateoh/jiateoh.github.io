<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/">Professor Miryung Kim</a> in the Software Evolution and Analysis Laboratory. I also work closely with <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/">Professor Harry Xu</a> and <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~gulzar/">Professor Mohammad Ali Gulzar</a>. Prior to joining UCLA, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from UC Berkeley and worked for three years at LinkedIn Corporation in the Data Analytics Infrastructure group.

	My current research interests focus on improving developer experiences with big data systems. I previously investigated performance debugging tools for Apache Spark and how job performance can be attributed to individual data records. My most recent publication investigates how to improve provenance effectiveness in dataflow systems by incorporating UDF knowledge. My current research is heading into the direction of debugging large-scale machine learning systems. More information about my research and previous work experience can be found <a href="/experience">here</a> - feel free to reach out if you are interested in having a chat!
