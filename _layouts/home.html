<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/">Professor Miryung Kim</a> in the Software Evolution and Analysis Laboratory. Prior to joining UCLA, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from UC Berkeley and worked for three years at LinkedIn Corporation in the Data Analytics Infrastructure group.

	My current research interests focus on improving developer experiences with big data systems. At the moment, I am investigating performance debugging tools for Apache Spark and how job performance can be attributed to individual data records. More information about both my current and previous research can be found <a href="/research">here</a>.
