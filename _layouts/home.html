<!-- <p>
	I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/">Professor Miryung Kim</a> in the Software Evolution and Analysis Laboratory. I also work closely with <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/">Professor Harry Xu</a> and <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~gulzar/">Professor Muhammad Ali Gulzar</a>. Prior to joining UCLA, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from UC Berkeley and worked for three years at LinkedIn Corporation in the Data Analytics Infrastructure group.

	I am currently working as a Sr. Software Engineer at Twitter! Prior to starting there, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2022 at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/">Professor Miryung Kim</a> in the Software Evolution and Analysis Laboratory. I also worked closely with <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/">Professor Harry Xu</a> and <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~gulzar/">Professor Muhammad Ali Gulzar</a>. Prior to joining UCLA, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from UC Berkeley and worked for three years at LinkedIn Corporation in the Data Analytics Infrastructure group.

	My research focuses on improving developer experiences with Big Data systems, with an emphasis on performance and correctness debugging. My prior works investigate how to enhance performance debugging for computation skew in Apache Spark and improve data provenance precision in dataflow applications through a combination of taint analysis and influence-based aggregation functions. More recently I have explored techniques which leverage targeted fuzz testing of individual user-defined functions in tandem with skew-inspired mutation operators to generate workloads which reproduce specified performance symptoms, particularly in scenarios where no suitable datasets are available.
